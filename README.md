# CCAPDEV MCO: Web Application
## Concept:
The concept is an Online Computer Store where there are 2 users who can access the website, namely the buyers and the seller. 
There is only 1 seller but for the convenience of the seller, a dashboard was made for the seller to add products, restock products, 
and many more. Buyers can buy products by adding these products to their cart and checking it out. We focused on the category of Computer, 
with subcategories of Laptops, Monitors, Data Storage, Peripherals, Networking, Printer and Scanner.

## Features:
